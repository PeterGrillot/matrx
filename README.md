# Matrx

Select a Tile to begin, then select adjacent tiles to add them up to 10. The goal is to select the most amount of tiles to reach 10 (Count). [0] tiles are ideal as they don't increase your count, but are woth points. You have 3 Rounds. First 4 counts are worth 100pts each, 5 counts and on are worth 1000pts!

## Scoring Examples

[8][2] => 200pts :(
[0][0][3][4][3] => 500pts! :)
[0][0][1][2][3][0][2][2] => 3500pts! :D
